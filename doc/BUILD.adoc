= Build Zen from source

If this is your first time to build Zen from source,
we recommend that you build in the order described in this guide.

== Install packages

See the https://www.zwin.dev/getting_started/installation#install-packages[Install package]
section of the general installation guide.
These packages are what we need to build Zen.

== Build & Install

Use clang for build.

```
$ export CC=clang
$ export CXX=clang++
```

=== Zwin

See https://github.com/zwin-project/zwin#build--install[Build & Install] in Zwin README.

=== Zen Mirror

See https://github.com/zwin-project/zen-mirror/blob/main/doc/BUILD.adoc[Build Zen Mirror from source].

=== zen-remote

Instead of cloning zen-remote again, we recommend using zen-remote in
the zen-mirror's git submodule: +
`zen-mirror/app/3rdParty/zen-remote`.

See https://github.com/zwin-project/zen-remote#build--install[Build & Install] in zen-remote README.
